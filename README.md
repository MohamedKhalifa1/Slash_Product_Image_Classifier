# Slash Ecommerce Product Image Classifier

![Slash Ecommerce](Slash-Logo.webp)

Welcome to the Slash Ecommerce Product Image Classifier repository! This project provides a solution for automating product image categorization within the Slash ecommerce app. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we enable efficient organization and classification of product images, enhancing the user experience and backend operations.

## Overview

The Product Image Classifier utilizes deep learning methodologies to classify product images into relevant categories. This repository contains the necessary code and resources to train, evaluate, and deploy the classifier within the Slash ecommerce app environment.

### Key Features:
- **Customizable Training**: Train the classifier using your own dataset to tailor it to your specific product categories.
- **Efficient Categorization**: Automatically classify product images into predefined categories, reducing manual effort and improving workflow efficiency.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilizes scalable deep learning architectures to handle large volumes of product images effectively.
